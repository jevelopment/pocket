These two scripts help me save stuff i want to read later. 
I like the firefox pocket app but i dont like how i have to sign into pages i save there and also it just gets to bee to much for me with the commercials and stuff. 

I am total amateur and i made this with chatgpt. feel free to use it and improve it - it would make me happy :) 

It does need xsel and xdotool installed and the pdf part relies on firefox - or at least something where the process of printing is similar.
