These two scripts help me save stuff i want to read later. 

If you mark text and run the pcket.sh script it will copy the text and put it in a file in ~/pocket. the files will get the name as the timestampt of running the script. 
The pcketpdf.v3.sh script just uses xdotool to print the screen and then put the print as a pdf (if that is your firefox standard output) in ~/pocket. 

I then use syncthing to sync that folder to my phone and other devices. it works for me but it would be nice to have it be nicer some how... feel free to improve it if anyone ever sees this... 

I use i3 to trigger the two scripts - you may need something else to trigger them. 

I like the firefox pocket app but i dont like how i have to sign into pages i save there and also it just gets to bee to much for me with the commercials and stuff. 

I am total amateur and i made this with chatgpt. feel free to use it and improve it - it would make me happy :) 

It does need xsel and xdotool installed and the pdf part relies on firefox - or at least something where the process of printing is similar.
